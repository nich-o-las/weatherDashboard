# Weather Dashboard

### Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/JQuery.

## User Story: 
### As a delicated and fair person who is sensitive to the elements, I would like to: 
1. See the weather in whichever city I search.
2. See both the current weather, and the future forecast.
3. Easily select cities that I've searched in the past.

#### Deployed App: https://nich-o-las.github.io/weatherDashboard/
